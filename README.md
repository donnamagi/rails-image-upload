# Rails Image Upload

## Introduction

This Rails app demonstrates a user-friendly image upload feature. Utilizing Rails Active Storage combined with Turbo Frames, the app showcases dynamic but lean image upload capabilities.

## Core features

1. **Polymorphic Image Galleries**: The app leverages a polymorphic association to enable different models to have an associated image gallery, with minimal code repetition.

2. **User friendly uploads**: Users can upload one or multiple images at a time, enabling better UX. Formatting of the file uploads is handled by the image galleries controller.

3. **Reordering and deletion**: Users can easily rearrange their image galleries with drag-and-drop functionality, thanks to the `acts_as_list` gem and SortableJS. 


This demo application is meant to showcase the practical use of advanced Rails functionalities like Active Storage and Turbo Frames, and how they can be used to create a dynamic and interactive user experience inside Rails. Additionally, the polymorphic relationship model enables to keep the database structure lean and scalable.
